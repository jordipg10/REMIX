!> This subroutine is the interface to solve a reactive mixing iteration for components in a target water
!> It has to be called for each target water in the domain at every time step
!> It is supposed to be called after the conservative transport has been solved
!> It assumes there are both equilibrium and kinetic reactions
!> It uses Euler explicit and applies lumping to the kinetic mixing ratios
!> It receives the concentrations after conservative transport as an argument, and returns the concentrations after reactive mixing as an argument as well
